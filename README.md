# Autonomous Light Mapping Network on Dual-Axis Solar Tracker System for Optimized Energy Harvesting

The main objective of this thesis is to design and develop an autonomous dual-axis solar tracker. This system will be based on a grid network of light sensitive sensors that provides input coordinates to dynamically adjust the panel’s position, optimizing the energy absorption throughout the day. 
The thesis will focus on:

•	Designing a dual-axis solar tracker system that incorporates both mechanical and electronic solutions.

•	Developing an intelligent, affordable, and scalable small scale prototype.

•	Testing the system’s performance under varying light conditions to assess its efficiency.

•	Evaluating the theoretical feasibility of the large scale prototype, and possible extrapolation to real world application.
